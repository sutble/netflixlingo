Hey guys, I was doing DuoLingo when I noticed something.

My vocab and reading comprehension were getting better, but my ability to listen to Spanish was not. I tried watching Netflix to get a grasp on the spoken part of the language but I hit a completely different problem with the subtitles...

Subtitles OFF:

I canâ€™t understand what they're saying because they're speaking too damn fast.

Subtitles ON:

I just ended up reading the subtitles completely and tuned out the language. (This is probably why people who watch a lot of subbed anime don't end up accidentally learning Japanese).

So this is my attempt at a solution. So far, its working pretty well, though the format could be improved. Just wanted to share and see if anyone else was interested in this.
